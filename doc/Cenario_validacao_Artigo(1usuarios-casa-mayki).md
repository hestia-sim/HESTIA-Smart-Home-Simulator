<h2> :eyes: Description of Activities and Interactions</h2>
Mayki, the only resident, has a structured routine, alternating between periods of work, rest and household chores. He starts the day using the computer in his room, alternating with breaks to drink water, brush his teeth and prepare breakfast. The activities are interspersed with short rest breaks and moments dedicated to organizing the space.
In the morning, Mayki uses the computer for about 30 to 60 minutes, followed by short trips to perform quick tasks, such as drinking water or going to the balcony. In the afternoon, he continues to use the computer for studies or work, keeping the devices activated.
In the evening, Mayki alternates between periods of computer use and moments of relaxation. On some days, he extends his computer use until the early hours of the morning, returning to rest soon after.
On weekends, his routine is more flexible, with longer sessions on the computer and additional periods of rest. The activities vary between organizing the space and using the devices for leisure and personal tasks.
