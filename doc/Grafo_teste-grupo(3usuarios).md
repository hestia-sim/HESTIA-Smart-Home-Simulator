* **Entertainment:** Watching TV and listening to music for adjustable durations.
* **Studying:** Periods dedicated to concentration and learning.
* **End of Routine:** Ending the day's activities after using devices.


<h2> :eyes: Description of Activities and Interactions</h2>

The scenario consists of three residents — Gustavo, Amanda and Vitor who share the space, adjusting their routines according to individual preferences.

Gustavo starts the day by arriving home and alternating activities such as watching TV for 30 to 120 minutes, with breaks to go out and return after longer periods away. He prefers the air conditioning set to 20°C, the TV on high volume and bright lighting for comfort and entertainment.

Amanda follows a balanced routine, dividing her time between watching TV, listening to music and taking short breaks. She prefers to keep the air conditioning at 27°C in automatic mode and moderate volume on the TV and sound system. She likes to divide her time between leisure and calmer activities, such as listening to music for 30 minutes before ending the day.

Vitor has a more intense pattern of use of the living room, spending long periods watching TV or studying. He sets the air conditioning at 23°C in wind mode, prefers high volumes for the TV and sound system and alternates moments of relaxation with long study sessions.

Weekend routines vary with more leisure time, extended device use, and fewer transitions between rooms. Automation adjusts devices to personal settings, providing a comfortable and functional environment for everyone.
