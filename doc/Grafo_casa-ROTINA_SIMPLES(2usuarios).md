<h2> :eyes:Description of Activities and Interactions</h2>
Gustavo, who works remotely, starts his day by waking up in Bedroom 01 and heading to Bathroom 02 to take care of his personal hygiene. He then has coffee in the kitchen, where the coffee maker turns on automatically, before starting his workday at the office. During work, Gustavo keeps the air conditioning and lighting on to create a comfortable environment. He takes a break at noon to have lunch in the kitchen and returns to the office in the afternoon. At the end of the day, Gustavo prepares dinner, watches TV in the living room to relax and ends the night by taking a shower and sleeping in Bedroom 01, with the air conditioning set to his preferred temperature.

Amanda, on the other hand, has a different routine because she works away from home. She wakes up in the same room as Gustavo, shares the bathroom for morning hygiene and has coffee before leaving for work. When she returns in the early evening, Amanda has dinner in the kitchen and enjoys leisure time watching TV in the living room. After relaxing, she takes a shower in Bathroom 02 and sleeps in Bedroom 01, setting the air conditioning to a higher temperature and on automatic mode. On weekends, Amanda and Gustavo follow more flexible routines, including activities such as going for walks, cooking together, washing clothes in the laundry room and watching TV for longer periods of time.

The interactions between the residents reflect an efficient and shared use of the spaces and devices in the house. While Gustavo uses the office to work during the day, Amanda uses the living room for leisure in the evening. They both share the bathroom and kitchen without conflict, with well-distributed schedules. During the weekends, the coexistence intensifies, with collaborative activities and moments of relaxation.
